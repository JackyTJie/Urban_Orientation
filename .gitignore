# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you intend to use it in a Docker container, you may prefer to exclude it.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but you may prefer to remove it
#   if it contains local configurations.
#.pdm.toml

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
